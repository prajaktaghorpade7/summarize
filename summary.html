			<h2> Oliver Twist </h2>
			<div id="summ">
				<p>
				Further away from London a women gave birth to a child and died. Considering the fact that nobody knew a thing about his origin the child got a name and a surname depending on the alphabetical order the children were signed in when they were born. That’s how this child got the name Oliver Twist. </p>
				<p>
				The little kids in this institution were growing up in poverty and misery. The small resources that the institution had were running out because some of the employees were stealing them. Also, the employees used to hit the children and that just increased their misery. </p>

			<h2> Merchant Of Venice </h2>
			<div id="summ">

				<p>In Venice, a merchant named Antonio worries that his ships are overdue. As his colleagues offer comfort, his young friends—Bassanio, Graziano, and Lorenzo—arrive. Bassanio asks Antonio for a loan, so that he can pursue the wealthy Portia, who lives in Belmont. Antonio cannot afford the loan. Instead, he sends Bassanio to borrow the money on the security of Antonio's expected shipments. </p>
				
				<p>
				At Belmont, Portia and her maid, Nerissa, discuss the suitors who have come in response to Portia's father's strange will. <span id="dot1"><br><a href="mov.html" id="showmore" onclick="merchant()">&nbsp;..... <span id="Readmore">Read more</span>&nbsp;</a></span> 
				
				<div id="mobile"> 
				The will says Portia may only marry a man who chooses the correct casket made from three possible options: gold, silver, and lead. Much to Portia's distress, all her suitors are unsatisfactory. However, she does fondly remember a time when Bassanio came to Belmont, and that leaves her with some hope. </p>
